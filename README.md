# A* algorithm
Not-so-optimised code for running the A* algorithm on a given graph.
## Shortest path
The A* (or A-star) algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph when given a start and an end node. It takes into account the lengths of the edges connecting the nodes, and the heuristic function. This specific code can be used for any graph, if you set the lower bounds and edge lengths to 0.

# Input
You're basically guided through the entire setup process, it is however useful to know what a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) _is_.
